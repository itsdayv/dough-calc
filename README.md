# dough-calc

Calculate the amount of flour, water, sugar, oil, and yeast for your recipe - at the hydration level you specify, based on the total amount of dough you wish to create.

This comes in useful for time where you know you need 900g of dough (but maybe the recipe you have is just for 1000) or you know you need 3 x 350g dough balls equaling 1050, etc.
